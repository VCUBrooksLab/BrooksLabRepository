%----- Concise, succinct statement about what was done. -----
%--- Something like: "This work is about developing and using pipelines for metabolic reconstructions" ---
\indent The decreasing costs of next generation sequencing technologies and the increasing speeds at which they work have lead to an abundance of 'omic datasets. The need for tools and methods to analyze, annotate, and model these datasets to better understand biological systems is growing.  Here we present a novel software pipeline to reconstruct the metabolic model of an organism \textit{in silico} starting from its genome sequence and a novel compilation of biological databases to better serve the generation of metabolic models.  We validate these methods using five \textit{Gardnerella vaginalis} strains and compare the gene annotation results to NCBI and the FBA results to Model SEED models.  We found that our gene annotations were larger and highly similar in terms of function and gene types to the gene annotations downloaded from NCBI.  Further, we found that our FBA models required a minimal addition of transport reactions, sources, and escapes indicating that our draft pathway models were very complete. We also found that on average our solutions contained more reactions than the models obtained from Model SEED due to a large amount of baseline reactions and gene products found in ASGARD.

\indent\indent The author wishes to thank several people who were pivotal in the completion of this project and his education. First, I would like to thank my advisor and mentor Dr. Paul Brooks whose guidance and oversight were a key element in my journey. Dr. Stephen S. Fong and Dr. Maria C. Rivera for participating on my committee and whose insight and instruction were pivotal in my success. Next, Dr. Allison Johnson and Dr. Herschell Emery whose constant positive encouragement and advice kept me progressing forward. Dr. Jeff Elhai for being my toughest critic and driving me to really think critically about everything I thought I knew.\\
\indent I'd also like to thank Carlisle Childress and the other Center for High Performance Computing staff for all their hard work and helpfulness throughout the years.\\
\indent Last but not least, I would like to thank my family. My wife, AnaClarissa and son Harrison Norris for supporting me throughout this long and challenging journey. My parents James and Katina Norris, my brother Jesse and his wife Alix Norris who have taught me so much and encouraged me to learn more, do more and be a better person. Without all of their love and continued support, I would not have been able to do this.
