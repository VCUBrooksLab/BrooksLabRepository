It has been updated and periodically released since then based on new and curated genomic and biochemical knowledge. An update has now been built, named iJO1366, which accounts for 1366 genes, 2251 metabolic reactions, and 1136 unique metabolites. iJO1366 was (1) updated in part using a new experimental screen of 1075 gene knockout strains, illuminating cases where alternative pathways and isozymes are yet to be discovered, (2) compared with its predecessor and to experimental data sets to confirm that it continues to make accurate phenotypic predictions of growth on different substrates and for gene knockout strains, and (3) mapped to the genomes of all available sequenced E. coli strains, including pathogens, leading to the identification of hundreds of unannotated genes in these organisms. Like its predecessors, the iJO1366 reconstruction is expected to be widely deployed for studying the systems biology of E. coli and for metabolic engineering applications.},

A novel optimization problem helps quantitative understanding and rational metabolic engineering of metabolic reaction pathways. Maximizing the performance of a metabolic reaction pathway is treated as a mixed-integer linear programming formulation to identify changes in regulatory structure and strength and in cellular content of pertinent enzymes which should be implemented to optimize a particular metabolic process. A regulatory superstructure proposed contains all alternative regulatory structures that can be considered for a given pathway. This approach is followed to find the optimal regulatory structure for maximization of phenylalanine selectivity in the microbial aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway. The solution suggests that from the eight feedback inhibitory loops in the original regulatory structure of this pathway, inactivation of at least three loops and overexpression of three enzymes will increase phenylalanine selectivity by 42\%. Moreover, novel regulatory structures with only two loops, none of which exists in the original pathway, could result in a selectivity up to 95\%.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder in women of childbearing age. BV is characterized by a dramatic shift in the vaginal microflora, involving a relative decrease in lactobacilli, and a proliferation of anaerobes. In most cases of BV, the predominant bacterial species found is Gardnerella vaginalis. However, pure cultures of G. vaginalis do not always result in BV, and asymptomatic women are sometimes colonized with low numbers of G. vaginalis. Thus, there is controversy about whether G. vaginalis is an opportunistic pathogen and the causative agent of many cases of BV, or whether BV is a polymicrobial condition caused by the collective effects of an altered microbial flora. Recent studies of the biofilm-forming potential and cytotoxic activity of G. vaginalis have renewed interest in the virulence potential of this organism. In an effort to tease apart the aetiology of this disorder, we utilized in vitro assays to compare three virulence properties of G. vaginalis relative to other BV-associated anaerobes. We designed a viable assay to analyse bacterial adherence to vaginal epithelial cells, we compared biofilm-producing capacities, and we assessed cytotoxic activity. Of the BV-associated anaerobes tested, only G. vaginalis demonstrated all three virulence properties combined. This study suggests that G. vaginalis is more virulent than other BV-associated anaerobes, and that many of the bacterial species frequently isolated from BV may be relatively avirulent opportunists that colonize the vagina after G. vaginalis has initiated an infection.},

A novel synthetic oxidative module was further designed, which connects the cellular NADPH and ferredoxin pools by inserting into the model a NADPH-ferredoxin reductase. We then combined this in silico knock-in strain with a knockout strain design, resulting in an in silico production strain with a predicted 125\% increase in hydrogen yield. The in silico strains designs presented here may serve as blueprints for future metabolic engineering efforts of T. maritima.},

These models provide a means of rapidly translating detailed knowledge of thousands of enzymatic processes into quantitative predictions of whole-cell behavior. Until recently, the pace of new metabolic model development was eclipsed by the pace at which new genomes were being sequenced. To address this problem, the RAST and the Model SEED framework were developed as a means of automatically producing annotations and draft genome-scale metabolic models. In this chapter, we describe the automated model reconstruction process in detail, starting from a new genome sequence and finishing on a functioning genome-scale metabolic model. We break down the model reconstruction process into eight steps: submitting a genome sequence to RAST, annotating the genome, curating the annotation, submitting the annotation to Model SEED, reconstructing the core model, generating the draft biomass reaction, auto-completing the model, and curating the model. Each of these eight steps is documented in detail.},

Many such tools are restricted to one or a few data sources and classification schemes.

	abstract = {Cell robustness and complexity have been recognized as unique features of biological systems. Such robustness and complexity of metabolic-reaction systems can be explored by discovering, or identifying, the multiple flux distributions (MFD) and redundant pathways that lead to a given external state; however, this is exceedingly cumbersome to accomplish. It is, therefore, highly desirable to establish an effective computational method for their identification, which, in turn, gives rise to a novel insight into the cellular function. An effective approach is proposed for complementarily identifying MFD in metabolic flux analysis and multiple metabolic pathways (MMP) in structural pathway analysis. This approach judiciously integrates flux balance analysis (FBA) based on linear programming and the graph-theoretic method for determining reaction pathways. A single metabolic pathway, with the concomitant flux distribution and the overall reaction manifesting itself as the desired phenotype under some environmental conditions, is determined by FBA from the initial candidate sequence of metabolic reactions. Subsequently, the graph-theoretic method recovers all feasible MMP and the corresponding MFD. The approach's efficacy is demonstrated by applying it to the in silico Escherichia coli model under various culture conditions. The resultant MMP and MFD attaining a unique external state reveal the surprising adaptability and robustness of the intricate cellular network as a key to cell survival against environmental or genetic changes. These results indicate that the proposed approach would be useful in facilitating drug discovery.},

Combinatorial chemistry techniques coupled with high throughput screening protocols means that pharmaceutical companies are now dealing with an unprecedented number of NCEs on an annual basis.

In silico assessment of NCEs is rapidly emerging as the next wave of technology for early ADME/Toxicity prediction.

It contains metabolic and regulatory processes in the form of wiring diagrams, which can be used for browsing and information retrieval as well as a base for modeling and simulation. Thus it helps in understanding biological processes and higher-order functions of biological systems.
Currently the KEGG website uses semi-static visualizations for the presentation and navigation of its pathway information. While this visualization style offers a good pathway presentation and navigation, it does not provide some of the possibilities related to dynamic visualizations, most importantly, the creation and visualization of user-specific pathways.
Results: This paper presents methods for the dynamic visualization, interactive navigation and editing of KEGG pathway diagrams. These diagrams, given as KEGG Markup Language (KGML) files, can be visually explored using novel approaches combining semi-static and dynamic visualization, but also edited or even newly created and then exported into KGML files.

A transcriptional regulatory system (TRS) connects a cell's environmental cues to its genome and in turn determines which genes are turned “on” in response to these cues. Consequently, TRSs control which proteins of an intracellular biochemical reaction network are present. These systems have been mathematically described, often through Boolean expressions that represent the activation or inhibition of gene transcription in response to various inputs. We recently developed a matrix formalism that extends these approaches and facilitates a quantitative representation of the Boolean logic underlying a TRS. We demonstrated on small-scale TRSs that this matrix representation is advantageous in that it facilitates the calculation of unique properties of a given TRS. Here we apply this matrix formalism to the genome-scale Escherichia coli TRS, demonstrating for the first time the predictive power of the approach at a large scale. We use the matrix-based model of E. coli transcriptional regulation to generate novel findings about the system, including new functional motifs; sets of genes whose regulation is poorly understood; and features of the TRS structure.},

	abstract = {Constraint-based metabolic models are currently the most comprehensive system-wide models of cellular metabolism. Several challenges arise when building an in silico constraint-based model of an organism that need to be addressed before flux balance analysis (FBA) can be applied for simulations. An algorithm called FBA-Gap is presented here that aids the construction of a working model based on plausible modifications to a given list of reactions that are known to occur in the organism. When applied to a working model, the algorithm gives a hypothesis concerning a minimal medium for sustaining the cell in culture. The utility of the algorithm is demonstrated in creating a new model organism and is applied to four existing working models for generating hypotheses about culture media. In modifying a partial metabolic reconstruction so that biomass may be produced using FBA, the proposed method is more efficient than a previously proposed method in that fewer new reactions are added to complete the model. The proposed method is also more accurate than other approaches in that only biologically plausible reactions and exchange reactions are used.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Systems biology aims to understand the interactions of cellular components in a systemic manner. Mathematical modeling is critical to the integration and analysis of these components on a conceptual as well as mechanistic level. To date, detailed genome-scale reconstructions of metabolism have become available for a growing number of organisms. Although metabolism has an important role in cells, other cellular functions need to be considered as well, such as signaling, regulation, and macromolecular synthesis. For instance, the cellular machinery required for RNA and protein synthesis consists of a complex set of proteins. Here, we show that one can collect all of the necessary information for a prokaryotic organism to create a gene-specific, fine-grained representation of the macromolecular synthesis machinery. E. coli was chosen as a model organism because of the wealth of available information. The explicit representation of transcription and translation in terms of a mass-balanced network enables a detailed, quantitative accounting of the protein synthesis capabilities of E. coli in silico. Hence, this study demonstrates the feasibility of constructing very large networks and also represents a critical step toward building cellular models of growth that can account for gene-specific protein production in a stoichiometric fashion on the genome scale.},

One component of the innate immune system is the Toll-like receptor signaling network, which is responsible for transmitting activation signals from the outside of the cell to molecular machinery inside the cell. The innate immune system must be properly balanced, as excessive activation can lead to potentially lethal septic shock. Therefore, there is much interest in developing drugs that can mediate Toll-like receptor signaling so as to alleviate effects of excess activation. We present an in silico reconstruction of the Toll-like receptor signaling network and convert it into a mathematical framework that is suitable for constraint-based modeling and analysis. This approach leads to the identification of potential candidates for drug-based mediation. In addition to identifying targets for drug mediation of the Toll-like receptor network, we also supply a network model that may be continually updated and maintained.},

However, the high complexity and dynamic ranges for any species of proteomic samples, surpass the separation capacity and detection power of the most advanced multidimensional liquid chromatographs and mass spectrometers. Only a tiny portion of signals is selected for MS/MS experiments and a still considerable number of them do not provide reliable peptide identification. In this article, an in silico analysis for a novel methodology of peptides and proteins identification is described. The approach is based on mass accuracy, isoelectric point (pI), retention time (tR) and N-terminal amino acid determination as protein identification criteria regardless of high quality MS/MS spectra. When the methodology was combined with the selective isolation methods, the number of unique peptides and identified proteins increases. Finally, to demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology, an OFFGEL-LC–MS/MS experiment was also implemented. We compared the more reliable peptide identified with MS/MS information, and peptide identified with three experimental features (pI, tR, molecular mass). Also, two theoretical assumptions from MS/MS identification (selective isolation of peptides and N-terminal amino acid) were analyzed. Our results show that using the information provided by these features and selective isolation methods we could found the 93\% of the high confidence protein identified by MS/MS with false-positive rate lower than 5\%.},

This reveals a central role for post-transcriptional regulation in shaping tissue-specific metabolic activity profiles. The predicted tissue specificity of genes responsible for metabolic diseases and tissue-specific differences in metabolite exchange with biofluids extend markedly beyond tissue-specific differences manifest in enzyme-expression data, and are validated by large-scale mining of tissue-specificity data.

It is shown that for systems in which all fluxes have fixed signs, all elementary modes are given by the generating vectors of a convex cone and can, thus, be computed by an existing algorithm. The present analysis allows for the more general case that some reactions can proceed in either direction. Basic ideas on how to compute the complete set of elementary modes in this situation are outlined and verified by way of several examples, with one of them representing glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. These examples show that the elementary modes can be interpreted in terms of the particular biochemical functions of the network. The relationships to (futile) substrate cycles are elucidated.},

	abstract = {A method of analysis was presented in part I of this series for determining the fluxes in a biochemical network that are the optimal choices for experimental measurement. This algorithm is applied to two important biological models: Escherichia coli and a hybridoma cell line (167.4G5.3). Our results show that potentially poor choices for in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes exist for both model systems. For the subset of reactions in E. coli that was studied, the condition number of the augmented stoichiometric matrix reveals that a 60-fold amplification of experimental error during computations is possible. The biochemical network of the hybridoma cell is more complex than the E. coli system, and thus results in much larger possible error amplification--up to 100,000-fold. The physiological situations appear to have sensitivities that are less than 1/4 to 1/10 of those estimated by the condition number, and the maximum sensitivities are proportional to the condition number. These maximum sensitivities calculated using estimates of the fluxes and the worst possible error vector are upper bounds on the system's actual sensitivity. By examining the effect of measurement error on the sensitivity, the most probable sensitivity is calculated. These results indicate that an approximate two-fold increase in sensitivity of the E. coli system is likely when the worst set of fluxes are measured rather than the best set. The most likely sensitivity of the hybridoma system can range three orders of magnitude, depending on the set of fluxes that are measured. The propagation of experimental error during computations can be diminished for both systems by increasing the number of flux measurements over and above the minimum number of experimental measurements. The findings from these two model systems indicate that the calculation of the condition number can be a useful method for efficient experimental design, and that the usefulness of this method increases as the order of the system increases.},

	abstract = {Background:  Paramyotonia congenita (PMC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cold- or exercise-induced myotonia. PMC is caused by a mutation in SCN4A which encodes the α-subunit of the skeletal muscle sodium channel. Methods:  The patient was an 11-year-old Japanese girl who was diagnosed as having PMC. To confirm the diagnosis, an orbital ice-pack test and blinking tests were performed. Next, to identify the mutation, genetic analysis of SCN4A was performed. Finally, to evaluate the mutation effect on the protein structure, in silico protein modeling analysis was performed. Results:  Cold- and exercise-induced myotonia was reproduced in the patient with non-invasive bedside tests: ice-pack and blinking tests. In the genetic analysis, a missense mutation, c.4343G{\textgreater}A in SCN4A, was identified, which may result in an arginine to histidine substitution at 1448 in the protein sequence (p.Arg1448His). According to the protein modeling analysis, the mutation neutralized the positive electrostatic charge at 1448 in the DIV/S4 segment and disrupted the beginning of the helical structure in the DIV/S3-S4 linker of the SCN4A protein. Conclusions:  Diagnostic physical interventions in the patient confirmed the phenotype presentation consistent with PMC, and the in silico protein modeling analysis of p.Arg1448His predicted structural changes which can affect function of the protein. All the data confirmed the diagnosis of PMC in the patient and added to existing literature emphasizing the important role of arginine residue at 1448.},

New strategies have been developed for the annotation and representation of reference genomes and sequence variations derived from population studies and clinical outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Background. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge and is associated with important public health complications such as preterm birth and acquisition or transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted infections. Continued controversy concerning the pathogenesis of BV has led to a lack of progress in prevention and management of this infection.
Methods. Development of a conceptual model for the pathogenesis of BV based on review of past and current research.
Results. Our model suggests that BV is initiated by the sexual transmission of Gardnerella vaginalis, which has the appropriate virulence factors to adhere to host epithelium, create a biofilm community, and successfully compete with lactobacilli for dominance in the vaginal environment. The genetic diversity of G. vaginalis may result in virulent and avirulent strains. Symbiotic relationships with normally dormant vaginal anaerobes lead to increases in the latter which contribute to the symptoms of BV.
Conclusions. G. vaginalis is the pathogen responsible for the initiation of BV. Future research should focus on preventing its transmission and improved therapeutics for the biofilm infection that is caused by this pathogen and host anaerobes.},

	abstract = {Flux balance models of metabolism use stoichiometry of metabolic pathways, metabolic demands of growth, and optimality principles to predict metabolic flux distribution and cellular growth under specified environmental conditions. These models have provided a mechanistic interpretation of systemic metabolic physiology, and they are also useful as a quantitative tool for metabolic pathway design. Quantitative predictions of cell growth and metabolic by-product secretion that are experimentally testable can be obtained from these models. In the present report, we used independent measurements to determine the model parameters for the wild-type Escherichia coli strain W3110. We experimentally determined the maximum oxygen utilization rate (15 mmol of O2 per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum aerobic glucose utilization rate (10.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum anaerobic glucose utilization rate (18.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the non-growth-associated maintenance requirements (7.6 mmol of ATP per g [dry weight] per h), and the growth-associated maintenance requirements (13 mmol of ATP per g of biomass). The flux balance model specified by these parameters was found to quantitatively predict glucose and oxygen uptake rates as well as acetate secretion rates observed in chemostat experiments. We have formulated a predictive algorithm in order to apply the flux balance model to describe unsteady-state growth and by-product secretion in aerobic batch, fed-batch, and anaerobic batch cultures. In aerobic experiments we observed acetate secretion, accumulation in the culture medium, and reutilization from the culture medium. In fed-batch cultures acetate is cometabolized with glucose during the later part of the culture period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Genome-scale constraint-based models of several organisms have now been constructed and are being used for model driven research. A key issue that may arise in the use of such models is the existence of alternate optimal solutions wherein the same maximal objective (e.g., growth rate) can be achieved through different flux distributions. Herein, we investigate the effects that alternate optimal solutions may have on the predicted range of flux values calculated using currently practiced linear (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) methods. An efficient LP-based strategy is described to calculate the range of flux variability that can be present in order to achieve optimal as well as suboptimal objective states. Sample results are provided for growth predictions of E. coli using glucose, acetate, and lactate as carbon substrates. These results demonstrate the extent of flux variability to be highly dependent on environmental conditions and network composition. In addition we examined the impact of alternate optima for growth under gene knockout conditions as calculated using QP-based methods. It was observed that calculations using QP-based methods can show significant variation in growth rate if the flux variability among alternate optima is high. The underlying biological significance and general source of such flux variability is further investigated through the identification of redundancies in the network (equivalent reaction sets) that lead to alternate solutions. Collectively, these results illustrate the variability inherent in metabolic flux distributions and the possible implications of this heterogeneity for constraint-based modeling approaches. These methods also provide an efficient and robust method to calculate the range of flux distributions that can be derived from quantitative fermentation data.},

This approach is called extreme signaling pathway analysis and involves the description of network properties with systemically independent basis vectors called extreme pathways. From the extreme signaling pathways, emergent systems properties of the JAK-STAT signaling network have been characterized, including 1), a mathematical definition of network crosstalk; 2), an analysis of redundancy in signaling inputs and outputs; 3), a study of reaction participation in the network; and 4), a delineation of 85 correlated reaction sets, or systemic signaling modules. This study is the first such analysis of an actual biological signaling system. Extreme signaling pathway analysis is a topologically based approach and assumes a balanced use of the signaling network. As large-scale reconstructions of signaling networks emerge, such scalable analyses will lead to a description of the fundamental systems properties of signal transduction networks.},

Genomics is providing near complete information regarding the genes/gene products participating in cellular metabolism for a growing number of organisms. As the true functional units of metabolic systems are its pathways, the time has arrived to define metabolic pathways in the context of whole-cell metabolism for the analysis of the structural design and capabilities of the metabolic network. In this study, we present the theoretical foundations for the identification of the unique set of systemically independent biochemical pathways, termed extreme pathways, based on system stochiometry and limited thermodynamics. These pathways represent the edges of the steady-state flux cone derived from convex analysis, and they can be used to represent any flux distribution achievable by the metabolic network. An algorithm is presented to determine the set of extreme pathways for a system of any complexity and a classification scheme is introduced for the characterization of these pathways. The property of systemic independence is discussed along with its implications for issues related to metabolic regulation and the evolution of cellular metabolic networks. The underlying pathway structure that is determined from the set of extreme pathways now provides us with the ability to analyse, interpret, and perhaps predict metabolic function from a pathway-based perspective in addition to the traditional reaction-based perspective. The algorithm and classification scheme developed can be used to describe the pathway structure in annotated genomes to explore the capabilities of an organism.},

The SEED represents an ambitious effort to stimulate and support education, research, and collaboration relating to the analysis of genomic data. Its primary objective is to dramatically improve the ability of biologists to construct and propagate large-scale integrations containing hundreds of genomes, expression data, metabolic data and other forms of biological data needed to support the analysis of organisms. Its most notable benefit will be to enable analysis of newly sequenced genomes in the context of comparative data; such analysis will inevitably lead to far superior initial characterizations.
